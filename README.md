# FL Studio Plugin Organizer

This is a little tool that I've made for better organizing your 3rd party FL Studio plugins.

## Pre-requisites

In order to use this tool, you need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed on your machine.

## Usage

From the root of this repository, run the following command:

```bash
API_URL=http://localhost:8080 docker-compose up --detach
```

This will build everything that you need and start the tool.

After everything is started, you can access the tool at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You should the following screen:
